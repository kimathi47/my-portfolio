          Hi, My name is Robin Kimathi.<br />
          I am a software engineer with a passion for creating and building
          things.<br />
          I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Irvine with
          a degree in Computer Science.<br />
          I have experience in full-stack development, and I'm always looking to
          learn new technologies and improve my skills.<br />

          allow me to grow as a developer and contribute to a team that is
