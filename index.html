        <p>
          Hi, My name is Robin Kimathi.<br /> I am a software engineer with a
          passion for creating and building things.<br />
          I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Irvine with
          a degree in Computer Science.<br />
          I have experience in full-stack development, and I'm always looking to
          learn new technologies and improve my skills.<br />
          I'm currently looking for opportunities to work on projects that will
          allow me to grow as a developer and contribute to a team that is
          co-ordinating to change the world of technology.
